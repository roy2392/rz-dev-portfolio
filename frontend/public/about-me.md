Hi, I'm Roey Zalta ðŸ‘‹ As a software developer with a passion for AI innovation, I thrive when bridging cutting-edge generative AI with practical, impactful products.

Throughout my career, I've improved developer experience & security through Git infrastructure solutions while exploring AI integrations for developer workflows. I've been an early adopter of Claude models, experimenting with their capabilities to enhance code quality and development efficiency.

In my previous role, I built scalable data processing systems that transformed insurance industry data, laying the groundwork for my current focus on AI-powered applications.

My background in Industrial Engineering and Data Science brings an analytical perspective to AI engineering challenges. I specialize in modern tech stacks including React, Node.js, and AI frameworks, with a particular interest in how generative AI is transforming software development.

Outside work, I train for triathlons, practice Vipassana meditation, and mentor developers through Kravi-Tech & Genesis, often incorporating insights from AI advancements.
